            <p class="left-border">Finally, there is almost a global consensus amongst scientists that our planet’s climate ischanging. Evidence for climatic change has been collected from a variety of sources, someof which can be used to reconstruct the earth’s changing climates over tens of thousandsof years. Reasonable complete global records of the earth’s surface temperature since theearly 1800’s indicate a positive trend in the average annual temperature, and maximumannual temperature, most noticeable at the earth’s poles.</p>

            <p>Glaciers are considered amongst the most sensitive indicators of climate change. As theearth warms, glaciers retreat and ice sheets melt, which – over thelast 30 years or so –has resulted in a gradual increase in sea and ocean levels. Apart from the consequenceson ocean ecosystems, rising sea levels pose a direct threat to low–lying inhabited areasof land. Less direct, but certainly noticeable in the last fiteen yearsor so, is the effectof rising sea levels on the earth’s weather systems. A larger amountof warmer water inthe Atlantic Ocean, for example, has certainly resulted in stronger, and more frequent,tropical storms and hurricanes; unless you’ve been living under a rock over the lastfew years, you would have noticed this in the media (e.g. Hurricane Katrina in 2005,Superstorm Sandy in 2012). The same can be said over the Pacific Ocean, where low–lying areas of Bangladesh, India and Malaysia are more frequently than ever batteredby tropical cyclones. Closer to home, we have seen an increase in flooding events in theU.K. over the last fifteen years, with 2012 being the second wettest year on record.</p>

            <p>The world’s changing climate is also likely to give rise to an increase in the frequencyof periods of intense heat and drought. Though some parts of theworld are familiarwith the effects of extreme heat, we are beginning to see an increase in severe hot spellsin more temperate latitides – for example, the 2003 European heatwave which resultedin thousands of deaths. In drier parts of the world, this has resulted in an increase indevastating forest fires, and in developing counties an increase in famine.</p>

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <h3>Hurricane Katrina: late summer 2005</h3>
            <p class="left-border">Hurricane Katrina made landfall as a category 3 hurricane (on the Saffir–Simpson hurri-cane scale, which goes from 1 (weakest) to 5 (strongest)) just south–west of New Orleans,on 31st August 2005.</p>

            <img src="https://www.nps.gov/articles/images/Storms_SurgeKatrina.jpg?maxwidth=1200&autorotate=false" alt="NOAA: surge modeling results">
            <p>The tropical storm grew in intensity over theAtlantic ocean frommid–August, almost reaching hurricane category 5 status over the warm waters of theGulf of Mexico at one point. Apart from wreaking havoc in Cuba and other Caribbeanislands, the storm surge – the heightened levels of the sea as a result of extremely strongwinds caused by record air pressure lows – over–topped the New Orleans flood defencesystems (“levees” – see Figure 1.1) causing widespread flooding throughout the city andthe surrounding area. There was a mandatory evacuation of the city, although many ofthe city’s poorest people were left without transport and were trapped. It is estimatedthat the storm killed over 1,800 people (some are still unaccounted for), but displacedover a quarter of a million. Though still counting the cost, it is estimated that the stormcaused over 100 billion dollars worth of damage.  The highest one minute sustainedwind speed recorded was 175mph, and the maximum recorded sea–surge at New Orleansreached nearly 14 feet (not verified).</p>
            

            <h3>Superstorm Sandy: October 2012</h3>
            <p class="left-border">Hurricane Sandy, billed in the media as a “superstorm” or “perfect storm” becauseof its level of organisation, devasated parts of the Caribbean andthe mid–Atlantic andnortheastern states of the USA.</p> 
            <p>Sandy was the tenth hurricaneof a busy hurricane seasonin 2012, and was a category 2 at its peak intensity. Causing an estimated 65.6 billiondollars worth of damage, this is th second costliest hurricane in US history, after Katrina,and 253 people were killed. The highest one minute sustained wind speed recorded was110mph, and the maximum sea–surge recorded just off Long Islandwas around 10 feet.</p>
